# kuberneteth
deploy a private [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain network with kubernetes

another detailed guide can be found on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@cryptoctl/leveraging-kubernetes-to-run-a-private-production-ready-ethereum-network-b6f9b49098df)

## infrastructure
the manifest produced by [kuberneteth](./kuberneteth) should work on any platform where kubernetes is up and running.

Make sure to have kubernetes up and running, e.g. via the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/)

## deployment and cluster setup
the deployment of the ethereum network nodes happens via the `deployment.yaml` file that is created when calling the [kuberneteth](./kuberneteth) script

the deployment will set up a [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) cluster consisting of:

* a [bootnode](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Setting-up-private-network-or-local-cluster#setup-bootnode)
* genesis node (that writes the genesis block initially) - and starts to run normally afterwards
* miner node(s) (depending on the configuration in [kuberneteth.yaml](./kuberneteth.yaml))
* member node(s) (depending on the configuration in [kuberneteth.yaml](./kuberneteth.yaml))
* a monitor to watch the status of the cluster (via [ethereum-netstats](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-netstats) and [eth-net-intelligence-api](https://github.com/cubedro/eth-net-intelligence-api))

## limitations
* persistent storage of blocks and any data that is usually in the `datadir` (like `.ethereum`) is done via [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) -> make sure to keep it clean, as it is not managed (usually `rm -rf /var/lib/docker/geth-storage` on all k8s nodes should do the trick)
* depending on the workers (cpu) the mining time may vary

## configuration
the deployment can be configured on a high level via a yaml file [kuberneteth.yaml](kuberneteth.yaml)

options are:
```yaml
# configuration for the bootnode that makes the cluster nodes aware of each other - for that make sure bootnode has same genesis block
bootnode:
  nodekeyhex: 3bed8e0fa771475049cddac0fcc20a6cf1005e271e2b12ef339f213218b2dbdb
  # verbosity of the bootnode [1..9]
  verbosity: 9
  # assign an rpc/ipc port
  geth:
    NodeP2P_ListenAddr: 30301
    NodeP2P_DiscoveryAddr: 30303
    Node_DataDir: /etc/testnet/bootnode
# here you can add as many nodes as you like, name and configure them

    # this config values will end up in the k8s manifest directly
    k8s:

      nodePort_rpc: 30001
      nodePort_ipc: 30002
      replicas: 1
    # this config values will alter the geth config toml file which will end up as a ConfigMap in the k8s manifest
    geth:
      # address where the mining rewards will go to (optional)
      Eth_Etherbase: "0x023e291a99d21c944a871adcc44561a58f99bdbc"
      # threads (optional)

      Node_UserIdent: miner
      Node_DataDir: /etc/testnet/miner
      Node_HTTPPort: 8545
      Node_WSPort: 8546
      NodeP2P_ListenAddr: 30301
      NodeP2P_DiscoveryAddr: 30303
      # experimental built in dashboard (optional) only works on > v1.7.3
      #Dashboard_Port: 8080
      #Dashboard_Refresh: 3000000000
# keep adding nodes
# - member:

  # you can find suitable tags in https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go/tags/
  # due to some config file changes in geth it needs to be > 1.8.0
  version: stable
  network:
    # network id (1: mainnet, 3: ropsten, 4: rinkeby ... )
    id: 1101
    # public (true|false) is it a public network?
    public: false
  # hex value of initial difficulty defined in the genesis block
  difficulty: "0x400"
  # as it is a private cluster, provide a CIDR of the cluster's network
  # to prevent other nodes connecting from the outside
  NodeP2P_Netrestrict: "172.16.0.0/12"
  # general verbosity of geth [1..5]
  verbosity: 3
```

## workflow
once the kubernetes cluster is up and healthy (verify via `kubectl cluster-info`), you can deploy the geth cluster via the following sequence:

if you have set `keystore.secret` to `true` in [kuberneteth.yaml](./kuberneteth.yaml) create an account and upload the key

```bash
# create a new encrypted keyfile
$ geth account new
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
Address: {30a75c364a57d7479b7c5d16c5dc4dcc2176eb5b}
# upload it to the kubernetes server
$ kubectl create secret generic geth-key --from-file ~/.ethereum/keystore/UTC--2017-11-20T18-36-59.948336313Z--30a75c364a57d7479b7c5d16c5dc4dcc2176eb5b
```

if not, just copy any existing geth key to the `keystore` folder, and add it's name to `kuberneteth.yaml` or use the key that is already present in the folder if you just want to play around (password is 'linux')

once the key is provided you can just create the cluster with those 2 commands:

```bash
./kuberneteth # this will create a file called 'deployment.yaml'
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml # this will deploy the cluster to kubernetes
```

there are some services that are using specific ports to interact with the pods, which you can port forward to access them from your local machine.
services are:

* (json)rpc/ipc for each node, to connect e.g. [mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist) a useful application to send transactions deploy smart contracts, and interact with the network -> runs at [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)
* the `eth-netstats` dashboard -> visit [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## the monitoring dashboard (sreenshot example below)
```bash
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod | grep monitor | awk '{print $1}') 3001:3001
```

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cubedro/eth-netstats/master/src/images/screenshot.jpg?v=0.0.6 "Screenshot")

## connecting a wallet or any service that talks to the json rpc
```bash
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod | grep [SOME_NODE_POD_NAME] | awk '{print $1}') 8545:8545
```

### using mist wallet
if you're using mist to interact with the network, make sure to connect it to the network via:

```bash
./ethereumwallet --rpc http://localhost:8545 --node geth --network test
```

## tear down the cluster
to clean up and start from scratch:

```bash
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```

make sure to clean up the `hostPath` manually

## deploying contracts
once your ethereum cluster is running, you can start to publish contracts. i have started with a simple [example](contracts/provider.sol) derived from a good introduction that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_coM_g7Dbg)

however i have also starte my own example, it's a small video ad platform, that you can find [here](contracts/blockads). just deploy [this](contracts/blockads.sol) contract, adapt [index.html](contracts/blockads/index.html) by adding the right contract address and contract abi.

## running a distributed application
the next step is to write an application that leverages the capabilities of your smart contract. there are several ways to do this, as there are already many integrations and libraries around that are able to communicate with a contract.

a good point to start is:

* [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) - getting started [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
* [Embark.js](https://github.com/iurimatias/embark-framework) - a framework for dApp development
* and probably many others that I don't know yet...
